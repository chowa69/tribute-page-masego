  <div class="section-1">
    <p> Micah "Masego" Davis is a 29 year old Jamaican-American and singer known for incorporating the saxophone into his music.  in highschool he adopted the name "Masego" which is a Tswana translation of his church name "blessing." Davis released two EPs (EP stands for 'Extended Play,' meaning that an EP is longer than a single but shorter than an album) The Pink Polo EP with Medasin, and Loose thoughts in 2016. Davis gained widespread attention with his collaborative record with FKJ called "Tadow" in 2017. Micah first learned how to play the drums without formal lessons in his youth. Davis attended Woodside High School (Virginia) and Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia before leaving to focus on his musical career. </p>

    <p> Micah Davis was born to a Jamaican father and an African American mother. His father was in the U.S. Air Force and his Mother was an entrepreneur. He also has two sisters and a brother in law. One of his sisters is a musical artist as well, the other is involved in acting and media outlets. Both his mother and father were also pastors and he was raised in a non-denominational Christian home frequently filled with the sounds of Black music like Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin and Cab Calloway. The military travels eventually led his family to Virginia. He also lived in Sumter, South Carolina for a couple of years while his family was moving around from state to state. Drawing from his upbringing of both his parents being pastors, Davis stated that church allowed him a place to learn music from talented musicians.  </p>

  <p>His friends from the hood led him to acquire trap music tastes, the “actual drug-cooking music with the hard-hitting drums,” as he describes it. Thus, the 26-year-old paved his own “trap house jazz” lane: a fusion of the genres, primarily R&B, jazz, and hip-hop, in perfectly smooth harmony. All of Davis's major influences are women. Led by his mother, Masego was brought to many of his favorite artists by way of the women in his life. Fun fact, Masego was once bit by a fan in Seoul, Korea</p>
